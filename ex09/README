I discussed the exercise with:

no one

README for ex9:

Description:

a nostalgic game of asteroids

the files that we have are:
asteroid.py
asteroids_main.py
background013.png
screen1.py
ship.py
torpedo.py

Special Comments:
i bilt two games:
one that works with the screen code you wrote
and the second one that work with my version of 
the screen code. 
the difrent is only in the grapic of
the game and not in its play.
if you want to play with my vertion of the game just
change the name of screen1.py to screen.py and run the game.
