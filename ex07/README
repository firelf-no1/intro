README for ex7:
Description:
lots of function linear and non linear Recursion
Special Comments:
print_to_n(n) - a program that print's all the positive numbers 
                      up to n from small to large
print_reversed(n) - a program that print's all the positive numbers
                            up to n from large to small
has_divisor_smaller_then(n, i) - a function that's check if a number
                                          has any divider smaller then the input
is_prime(n) - a function to check if n is prime
divisors(n) - a function that calculate all the dividers of a number
divisors_loop(n, i, div_list) - a function that makes a loop for the
                                        function divisors
exp_n_x(n, x) - a function that calculate the mathematical term 
                       exp_n(x)
exp_loop(n, x, i, k, exp_list) - a function that makes a loop for the 
                                          function exp_n_x
play_hanoi(hanoi, n, src, dest, temp) - a function to solve the tower 
                                                        of hanoi
print_binary_sequences(n) - finds binary sequences in n length
sequences_loop(char_list, n) - a loop to find the sequences in a char list
duplicate_checker(ans_list) - checks if there are duplicate in the input list
print_sequences(char_list, n) - Create all permutations of a string with
                                             repeating characters
print_no_repetition_sequences(char_list, n) - Create all permutations of a
                                                     string with non-repeating characters
no_repetition_sequences_list(char_list, n) - Create all permutations of a
                                                   string with non-repeating characters
                                                   and gives a string output
