README for ex3:
Description:

Special Comments 
part D:
1. cyclic('abcd','bcda')
returns True becose it is still a cyclic permutation
2. histogram(3,[1,2,3,4])
returns [0,1,1] becose I told the progrem to run until n wich is 3 
3. prime_factors(0)
returns [] I programed the code to return [] for every number smaller then 2
4. pairs(2,[0,0,1,1,2,2])
returns [[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [1, 1]] becuse i did not programed the program to chack if there
are dubles in the input line.
